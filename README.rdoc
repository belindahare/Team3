== README

This was the last team project we completed at The Iron Yard.  It's purpose was to teach the front-end developers and the Ruby on Rails developers how to integrate their work.  The application was not required to be finished, it only required that we learn how to work with the new languages and figure out what part each of us would play in the development.

To run locally:
  clone the repository
  install bower
  bundle install
  rake db:create db:migrate
